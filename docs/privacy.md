**Privacy Policy for Pavement Condition Index (PCI) App**

**Effective Date:** 4 March 2025

**1. Introduction**

Welcome to the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) App ("the App"), developed jointly by Unnat Maharashtra Abhiyan, IIT Bombay, and Zilla Parishad, Ratnagiri ("we," "us," or "our").  We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the PCI App.

**2. Information We Collect**

To provide you with the services offered by the PCI App, we collect the following types of information:

*   **Personal Information (for Account Creation and Login):**
    *   **Email Address:**  Required for account creation and login.
    *   **Phone Number:** Required for account creation and login, and may be used for account verification and communication related to the App (if necessary).
    *   **Name:**  Used to personalize your experience and for account identification.

*   **Location Data:**
    
    The PCI App collects location data only with your explicit permission. When you grant location access, the App uses GPS to collect data only while assessing road conditions during a journey.
    * **No Automatic Tracking:** The App does not track your location in the background without your consent. Location access is requested, and data is collected only when you actively use the App for road condition assessment.
    * **Why Location Data?**
        - To accurately associate sensor data with specific road segments.
        - To ensure meaningful analysis of road quality.
        - To provide correct PCI calculations for different locations.
    * **Precise Location (GPS)**: The App collects location data only while it is actively in use to assess road conditions during your journey.
    * **No Background Tracking:** Location updates continue only to ensure data collection even if the App is minimized during an assessment. However, the App does not collect location data when not in use.

*   **Sensor Data:**
    *   **Accelerometer Data:** The App collects accelerometer data from your smartphone's sensors in the background while you are using the App for road assessments. This data is used to:
        *   Detect vibrations and movements of the device indicative of road surface conditions (e.g., bumps, potholes).
        *   Contribute to the calculation of the Pavement Condition Index (PCI).

*   **User Input Data:**
    *   **Pothole Counts (Textual Input):** You may manually input the number of potholes observed during your road assessment journey. This information supplements sensor data and contributes to the PCI calculation.

**3. How We Use Your Information**

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

*   **Providing and Improving the App:**
    *   To create and manage your user account.
    *   To enable you to log in and use the App's features.
    *   To collect and process sensor data, location data, and user input to calculate the Pavement Condition Index (PCI).
    *   To display the calculated PCI and related journey information within the App.
    *   To improve the App's functionality, accuracy, and user experience.
    *   To develop and refine our data model for relating sensor data to PCI.

*   **Research and Analysis:**
    *   To analyze aggregated and anonymized data to understand road conditions trends and patterns.
    *   To contribute to research and development efforts aimed at improving road infrastructure assessment technologies.
    *   To provide insights to Unnat Maharashtra Abhiyan, IIT Bombay, and Zilla Parishad, Ratnagiri for informed decision-making related to road maintenance and budget allocation.

*   **Communication (if necessary):**
    *   To communicate with you regarding your account, App updates, or technical issues (if necessary).

**4. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

**We DO NOT share your personal information or collected data with any third parties.**

*   Your data is used solely for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and is accessed only by authorized personnel involved in the PCI App project (developers, researchers, and relevant personnel from Unnat Maharashtra Abhiyan, IIT Bombay, and Zilla Parishad, Ratnagiri).
*   We may share anonymized and aggregated data for research and analysis purposes, but this data will not be linked to any individual user.

**5. Data Security**

We are committed to protecting your information and have implemented reasonable security measures to safeguard it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include:

*   **Data Encryption:**  Data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted using secure protocols.
*   **Secure Storage:** Data is stored in secure databases with restricted access controls.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.**

**6. Data Retention**

We will retain your personal information and collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws and regulations.  When your data is no longer needed, we will securely dispose of it.

**7. Children's Privacy**

**The PCI App is intended for use by adults who can safely operate a vehicle and assess road conditions while driving. It is not intended for use by children under the age of 16.**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at the contact information provided below. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will take steps to delete such information.

**The App requires users to travel and potentially drive to collect data.  Therefore, it is not suitable for children who cannot legally and safely operate a vehicle.**  We strongly discourage children from using this App.
