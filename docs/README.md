# Pavement Condition Index (PCI) App

Welcome to the **PCI App** being developed jointly by **Unnat Maharashtra Abhiyan, IIT Bombay and Zilla Parishad, Ratnagiri**. 

As we know, roads are being built in India at a rapid pace. Given that, ensuring that these roads meet a certain quality is of great importance. While there are expensive machines to test road quality, there is no simple technology to reliably test and log road quality. 

This project aims to contribute to change this by automating the assessment of road pavement conditions using an App.

# Overview
The project uses the Android smartphone as its basic platform.  By utilizing in-built smartphone sensors such as accelerometers and GPS, along with textual inputs like pothole counts, **PCI App** aims to compute the **Pavement Condition Index (PCI)**. The PCI will serve as a crucial parameter for informing both the engineer as well as the citizen about the quality of the road.

# Goals
- Develop software to gather sensor data systematically. 
- Formulate a data model to relate raw sensor data to the PCI
- Automate the assessment of road pavement conditions
- Develop a mobile app for data collection
- Create a central database for storage and analysis


# How it Works

1. **Data Collection:** The mobile app will utilize smartphone sensors to collect data on road conditions. This includes accelerometer data for detecting vibrations and GPS data for location tracking.
2. **Pavement Condition Index (PCI) Computation:** By processing the collected data, SmartRoads will compute the PCI, providing a quantitative measure of road pavement conditions.
3. **Database Management:** A central database will be created to store the collected data. This database will facilitate analysis and decision-making processes.
4. **Analysis and Decision Making:** With the computed PCI, authorities can make informed decisions regarding budget allocation and road maintenance strategies. This will lead to more efficient and effective road infrastructure management.


# Benefits
- **Efficiency:** Automation streamlines the assessment process, saving time and resources.
- **Accuracy:** Utilizing smartphone sensors ensures accurate data collection and analysis.
- **Informed Decision Making:** The PCI serves as a reliable metric for prioritizing road maintenance efforts.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** By targeting areas with the highest PCI, resources can be allocated more effectively, maximizing impact while minimizing costs.
