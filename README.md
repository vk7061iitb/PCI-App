# PCI App: Automating Road Pavement Assessment in Maharashtra

There exists no systematic way to centrally organize road development in Maharashtra, and much of India. This project aims to contribute to change this by automating the assessment of road pavement conditions.

## Overview

This project dedicated to improving road infrastructure management by leveraging modern technology. By utilizing in-built smartphone sensors such as accelerometers and GPS, along with textual inputs like pothole counts, PCI App aims to compute the Pavement Condition Index (PCI). The PCI will serve as a crucial parameter for informing budget allocation and road quality improvement strategies.

## Goals

- Automate the assessment of road pavement conditions
- Develop a mobile app for data collection
- Create a central database for storage and analysis
- Formulate a data model to relate raw sensor data to the PCI

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: The mobile app will utilize smartphone sensors to collect data on road conditions. This includes accelerometer data for detecting vibrations and GPS data for location tracking.

2. **Pavement Condition Index (PCI) Computation**: By processing the collected data, SmartRoads will compute the PCI, providing a quantitative measure of road pavement conditions.

3. **Database Management**: A central database will be created to store the collected data. This database will facilitate analysis and decision-making processes.

4. **Analysis and Decision Making**: With the computed PCI, authorities can make informed decisions regarding budget allocation and road maintenance strategies. This will lead to more efficient and effective road infrastructure management.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automation streamlines the assessment process, saving time and resources.
- **Accuracy**: Utilizing smartphone sensors ensures accurate data collection and analysis.
- **Informed Decision Making**: The PCI serves as a reliable metric for prioritizing road maintenance efforts.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: By targeting areas with the highest PCI, resources can be allocated more effectively, maximizing impact while minimizing costs.

## Future Developments

PCI App is committed to continuous improvement. Future developments may include:

- Integration with additional sensors for more comprehensive data collection
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis
- Collaboration with local authorities for widespread implementation
